# Model Break Views Sample
This sample demonstrates usage of the ModelBreakManager library which enables the creation of model break views in a HOOPS Communicator web viewer.  
Please see `./break_views/README.md` for details.

### Setup
1. Create a folder in this project's root directory called `hoops` and paste a copy of `hoops-web-viewer-monolith.iife.js` from the HOOPS Communicator package into this folder.
2. Use VS Code's Live Server extension or another development server to launch index.html.
